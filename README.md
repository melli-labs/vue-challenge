# Melli Vue 🖖 Challenge

Hi 👋, I am Melli!

Can you solve my frontend challenge?

## Challenge

This repo is a simple Vue 3 project with four different routes. Each route contains a different task focusing on Vue 3's Composition API, TailwindCSS & UI design, and the usage of a simple REST API. 

The goal is to solve all tasks and create a pull request to this repository with your solution. To admire your work 🤩, we will deploy your branch to `https://deploy-preview-##--emilia-vue-challenge.netlify.app`, where `##` is the number of your PR.

Happy coding!

## Setup

Clone the repository and then install the dependencies:

```
pnpm install
```

Start development server at http://localhost:3333:

```
pnpm dev
```

When you finish all tasks create a pull request. We would love to interview you 😍!
