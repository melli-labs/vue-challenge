The button at the top of the page should toggle my glasses. But the `showGlasses` variable is not reactive yet. We try to use the new Composition API in combination with the <script setup> style. If you are not familiar with it yet, read the new docs at https://vuejs.org/guide/introduction.html#api-styles.

When you are satisfied with your solution click the button at the top to go to the next task. P.S. If you wonder why TailwindCSS is not installed, we use the alternative Atomic CSS engine \'UnoCSS\' 🔥. But the class names are identical to TailwindCSS 🍃.',

The goal is to implement a simple notes 📝 application. Right now, the notes you can see here are using mock data. To complete this last task, you need to fetch the real data from our database 📊. Furthermore, it should be possible to create a new note using the \'New Note\' button and edit and delete notes using the dropdown menu. Most of the user interface is already there and you only need to implement the API logic. But of course, you are free to make improvements to the current UI 😊. When you\'re done ✅, hit the big yellow button at the top right!',

The first screen consists of a navbar and a list of contacts 👥. Clicking on a contact opens a more detailed view of a single contact 👤. I recommend starting with the styling of the navbar located in `components/NavBar.vue`. Then I would style the contacts-list in `components/ContactList.vue`. Finally, I would design the detail page in `components/ContactDetail.vue`. When you are satisfied with your solution, click on the check icon ✅ in the navbar to finish the challenge 🏁.',
